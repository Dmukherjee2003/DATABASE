In V2, there are two modifications.They are a user who is able to create several playlists and who needs to store the user's account type.

The first one may be accomplished by removing the playlist property from the user table's composite primary key.(which was in V1 as only one playlist for one user)

The second change is made by including a new attribute in the user table called account_type.
